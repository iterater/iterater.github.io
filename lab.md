## History

The Digital Healthcare Lab (DHC Lab) grown from the collaboration of the researchers from ITMO University and Almazov National Medical Research Center. The collaboration was started in 2015 within the Institute of Translational Medicine (ITM) established this year at ITMO University. The focus of the collaboration was on decision support systems for medicine and healthcare with the incorporation of modeling, simulation, and intelligent technologies. The DHC Lab currently includes 15 members (4 PhDs) and 5 external collaborating researchers.

## Projects and directions

Being focused on the medical domain, the DHC Lab successfully extends and translates the experience in modeling, simulation, and intelligent technologies to the other (sometimes quite far) domains: social sciences, legal domain, oil&gas industry, hydrometeorology, computer vision, etc. The projects are arranged into several directions including:

- modeling and simulation of disease development (with a special focus on chronic diseases)
- process mining and text mining for medicine
- professional behavior modeling
- city healthcare environment
- modeling and simulation in epidemiology 
- modeling and simulation of a hospital environment
- medical informatics and decision support
- numerical modeling of human body
- and others
