## Personal cognitive modeling for decision making and decision support

<img src="/images/research_2d_intelligence.png" width="40%" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" />

While considering professional decision-making, an important yet unobservable part of the decision-making is human internal context and cognitive state. Being affected by personal experience, expertise, psychological characteristics, and personal values, it frames the personal strategies and preferences in professional decision-making. Within this direction, I'm trying to develop an approach for modelling of internal operator's cognitive state during decision-making with or without decision support system, perceiving of available information, and result in intelligent behavior.

## Human-AI and human-machine interaction in complex decision making

<img src="/images/research_xai.png" width="40%" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" />

Interaction between modern AI agents and human operators should be considered as bidirectional adaptive process aimed toward better collaboration. Here, each side of the process can reason about the opposite one in order to achieve personal and shared goals. To improve the process we can develop advanced techniques for communication (for example, by hiring explainable AI, XAI), propose novel approaches for cognitive reasoning and shared knowledge management in AI agent about human agent state, design adaptive multi-level feedback loops in information exchange.

## Modeling and simulation of professional and domain-specific behavior and decision making

<img src="/images/research_domain_behavior.png" width="40%" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" />

In many cases, the agents are influenced by complex environments, personal motivation, social interaction, and regulatory mechanisms. Within a complex external context of decision-making, people act like professionals doing their jobs managing problems and processes with high uncertainty by application of expertise, knowledge, and tools (including computational tools). Large-scale systems (such as healthcare system) may be become complex, with emergent phenomena being observed through social interaction and knowledge sharing. Here, I'm trying to approach on how behavior of such complex systems can be understood, explained, and optimized taking into account.

## Meta-modeling and model management for complex system modeling and simulation

<img src="/images/research_metamodeling.png" width="40%" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" />

As the complexity of a system grows the model to describe it becomes more and more complicated. As a result hybrid modeling, surrogate modeling, data-driven modeling approaches are combined within cross-domain knowledge-based reasoning and artificial intelligence to design, implement, identify and apply composite models for domain-specific tasks. How can the general approach to such a problem be developed to extend intelligent support of complex system modeling and simulation?
