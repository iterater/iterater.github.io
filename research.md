## Modeling and simulation of professional and domain-specific behavior and decision making

<img src="/images/research_domain_behavior.png" width="250" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" />

In many cases, the agent is influenced by complex environments, personal motivation, background domain knowledge, and regulatory mechanisms. Within a complex environment, people act like professionals doing their jobs. Such activity includes both professional and general motivation, reasoning, and planning. How such behavior may be understood, explained, and optimized (both for the personal goals of an agent and for the global system-level performance)?
